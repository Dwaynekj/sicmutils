;; WHERE WE LEFT OFF:
;;
;; To avoid simplification oscillation syndrome, we need
;; a hermetic simplify, which means we need (I think!) a
;; simplify that clears the expr->var, var->expr maps before
;; entering. (as we just proved by using reset!).
;;
;; how to proceed? two kinds of analyzer, or one kind with
;; multiple entry points? Or imitate JSON and return an
;; object with closures in it?
;;
;; There is a fairly subtle question here. We don't want
;; the objects to be overly stateful. So maybe we want
;; to allow the creation of two different kinds.
