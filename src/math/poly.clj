;; this is ok so far as it doesn't generate an intermediate,

;; map on each step. would be nicer to accumulate a list of pairs
;; and then return (into (sorted-map) R).
;; that should be easy to arrange.

;; or maybe could use merge-with from core. But that doesn't take
;; advantage of sorted-ness, which I think we still want.
;; But its implementation does point to ways this could be simpler.
