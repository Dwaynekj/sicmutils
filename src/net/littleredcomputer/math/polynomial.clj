;; Monomials

;; the exponents of the indeterminates over some ring. For example;
;; we would represent x^2 as [2], and xy^2 as [1 2], though the
;; indeterminates have no name. Polynomials are linear combinations
;; of the monomials. When these are formed, it is important that the
;; monomial vectors all contain the same number of slots, so that
;; 3x + 2y^2 would be represented as: 3*[1 0] + 2*[0 2].

;; several observations. many of the gcds we find when attempting the troublesome
;; GCD are the case where we have two monomials. This can be done trivially

;;
;; secondly, we observe that lowering arity often produces constant polynomials.
;; can we get away with just dropping these to scalars, instead of constant
;; polynomials of lower degree?
;;
;; then we could special-case the question of GCD of a polynomial with a
;; basic number. That's just the gcd of the number and the polynomial's
;; integer coefficients.
;;
;; open question: why was dividing out the greatest monomial factor such
;; a lose? it's much cheaper to do that than to find a gcd by going down
;; the arity chain.
