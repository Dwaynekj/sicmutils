  ;; To move into Hamiltonian mechanics, we must fix the fact that
  ;; our literal functions currently support only arity 1. We won't
  ;; get far without fixing that.
  ;;
  ;; OK, what we have here (using literal-function2 as a stopgap)
  ;; doesn't quite give the right answer for the part containing
  ;; the partials of V, but it's a step forward. Why did zeros
  ;; enter the expansion? Also, should we copy the existing type
  ;; notation or make up our own? I like the idea of type exemplars
  ;; here: a type is either a thing, or [thing1 :to thing2], if it's
  ;; a function between two other things.
