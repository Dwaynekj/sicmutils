- repl needs to connect to simplifier somehow
- polynomials over different types
- comment about our type-sorting canonicalizaztion (something to think about)
- how about modular arithmetic once we have polynomials
- need to handle =. currently we're devolving to native, which works pretty well, 
- but not for things constructed with deftype.
- make polynomials useful: allow them to be applied to entities.
- but that opens up the question of literal functions...
- try lein check to see if we are doing unnecessary reflection
