- repl needs to connect to simplifier somehow
- expt
- polynomials over different types
- comment about our type-sorting canonicalizaztion (something to think about)
- how about modular arithmetic once we have polynomials
- need to handle =. currently we're devolving to native, which works pretty well, 
- but not for things constructed with deftype.
